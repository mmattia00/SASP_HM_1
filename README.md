For this homework assignment it will be explored the topic of acoustic source localization.
It will be provided a multichannel recording acquired using a uniform linear microphone array (ULA). 
The device known as EStick, is composed of 𝑀 = 16 MEMS microphones and it has a total length of 𝐿 = 45[cm].
The ULA works with an Audio-over-IP connection recording at 𝐹𝑠 = 8[kHz].
The acoustic scene recorded concerns a moving sound source in front of the ULA. 
The speed of sound has been measured as 𝑐 = 343[m/s].
The final goal is to localize the time-varying position of the source using a spatial filtering approach.
In particular, it is requested to design a delay-and-sum beamformer for the ULA and adapt it to 
localize wide-band sources.
